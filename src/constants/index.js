export const HERO_CONTENT = `Hello, I am currently an undergraduate at NSBM University of Sri Lanka studying Technology Management. Although I have only completed 1 year of studying yet, I am already experienced in a wide variety of technologies such as “React”, “MySQL”,"PhP" and “MongoDB”. Coding languages such as “C”, “C#”, "JavaScript" and “Python” are also nothing new to me. So much so that, “Python” is the programming language I am most familiar and flexible with. Overtime, I hope to create an exceptional record of achievements, driven by passion and maintained with discipline.`;
